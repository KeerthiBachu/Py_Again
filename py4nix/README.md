# Learning Python from the book
## OReilly's Python for Unix and Linux System Administration

Also following some additional references:
- Linux System Administration Basics on [LINODE docs](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/linux-system-administration-basics)
- IBM's brief on [Python for system administrators](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-python/)

This work just started, so it is not much of use if somebody is looking for some reliable and useful resource. This is for my personal tracking.
